# Future Me

I have three goals in life. The first is to be happy. I feel if you are not satisfied with life and happy with a large portion of what you do, life will be hard to enjoy. The second goal is to make tools that let others collaborate, create and share. I think the real benefit of technology is creating the global community and breaking down barriers that let people to create and be happy. The final goal in my life is to never stop learning. Absorbing and sharing information has been one of the most enjoyable aspects of my life.

In the next ten years, I hope to be acheiving these three goals. I think the first goal will be maintained by living in area where I have friends, has a decent amount of art locally, and my room having a lot of windows (I am like a plant you see, I need sunlight!). The second goal is a lot harder. I have shown that I am very cable of creating systems that do these things, but finding the right company to work for that has a large audience and yet still a fun and small working environment will be difficult. The company I feel that would probably work best for me, right now, is GitHub, but friends and co-workers have told me that I would do well to start a business, so who knows. Whatever the case may be, I don't plan on working for a company that is larger than 100 people and one where I don't have significant impact on the companies goals and policies.
