# Paper Ideas.

I need to write a paper proposal for Dr. Turner. It's actually a pretty large document, so I need to get started now.

 * Information Distribution - the ethics of building systems to promote information dissemination.
   * iFixit, Wikileaks, Wikipedia... etc.
   * Teachers, others
   * the difference between a company that provides a tool to distribute information (Wikipedia, iFixit) and a person that distributes information and a person who uses a tool.

 * The ethics of Julian Assange
   * Not sure what, but Turner likes the man...

 * The ethics of misrepresenting yourself on the internet
   * using a handle
   * California's new law
