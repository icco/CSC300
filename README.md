This is Nathaniel Welch's paper, not yours. You can read it, provide fixes, and the like, but you can not turn this paper in with your name on it.

No guarantees of the accuracy of this information is given. This is just what worked for me on my system.

The .bib file is where you put all your citations. Read some of the references in that file for more info on the bibliography system in LaTeX

The .tex file is where you create the document, it then takes a .bbl file that is created from the .bib file and uses that to add the citations to your paper.

The IEEannot.bst file create a bibliography style that allows for annotations. I found that placing this file in the same folder as the .bib and .tex files worked fine.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX is a great reference for learning about tex.

In the make file replace template in MAIN, TEXFILES, and BIBFILES with the name of your file.
