...

## 1.7.10

Talked about the two articles we wrote.

## 1.10.11

 * our paper
   * take a stand in abstract
   * choose a specific case

 * IEEE, microsoft, ACM, AMA code of ethics - check out
   * acm.org/about/se-code

 * We have an ethical code so that people don't shoot each other to solve their problems
   * you can focus on creating instead of just trying to protect your property.
   * what is good?
   * does this code of ethics govern me?
   * are students professionals? are students covered by the code.
 * penalties for disobeying the code?
   * none really right now. why?
 * conflicts of interest - make sure you know define
   * 4.05

### Ethical Systems Presentations

 1. Present the system - it's advantages / disadvantages
 2. Table of distinctions with the other listed systems (brief, simple)
 3. A worked out example using your system in a software team situation

 * 15-20 min
 * slides good but optional
   * handout, webpage would work as well
 * everyone needs to talk

We are talking on Objectivism + Relativism

## 1.12.11

He had his coffee today, jumping right into stuff.

### How to read a paper / book

 1. Author Info
   a. Why?
   b. Where now?
 2. High level mechanical
   a. what question does author address
   b. what do they conclude?
   c. look over index, bibliography, glossary.
 3. A quick read
 4. A careful read
   a. notes
   b. what question do they address?
   c. what are the main tradeoffs / arguments - super duper important
   d. What arguments support the author's conclusion? How sound are they?
   e. Is this an important result?

### Testing Reliability Article

   * testing away failure

## 1.14.11

 * We have the least authority to decide if our projects have value (good/bad/etc)
 * if you are inventing something new (nuclear power), you can't declare the mean time to failure as 100 years.
 * Trans-science: making decisions on value judgments and on things that can't be tested realistically.
 * Scientists can't really be argued with in court
 * lookup contingent fees for lawyers
 * how does bringing software into things make it different (good thought for paper)
   * you're writing instructions for a machine
   * static instructions for a dynamic machine

## 1.21.11

How to answer a turner exam question

 1. Read it over carefully.
 2. Choose separate parts that may be modularized (answered separately).
   * Object Oriented exam answering.
 3. Use sub-headings to separate parts.
 4. When referring to an SE Code provision, utilize both the section number and quote.
   * Narrow and simplify as much as you can to get Turner to believe.
 5. If you aren't answering a question, don't put it in your paper
   * Fluff is bad.
 6. No citations means death
   * "Not documenting means more maintenance" - proof? Citation, how do you know, why should I believe you?
 7. Never start a paragraph with your conclusion
   * you'll be thinking that you're right
   * start with question or fact.
 8. Always use short, simple sentences.
   * less commas, less semi-colons
   * Spelling + Grammar
 9. When you've completed your answer, review it! Did you really answer the question?

 * Read Strunk & White

## 1.24.11

 * Be more skeptical, assume the user doesn't agree with you at all
 * Be a journalist, not a Rush Limbaugh
 * Choose exactly one of the provisions from SE-Code
 * be narrow
 * Truth tables? Do logical proofs?
 * 2/3 paragraphs, 1 page.
 * start paragraph w/ question or controversial fact.
   * not conclusion.
 * Dialectic - classic dialog and discussion
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic
   * Thesis
   * antithesis
   * synthesis
 * talk about letters of recommendation

## 1.28.11

Talk by Jim "Cope" Coplien

 * Form not structure, but rather the "essence of structure"
 * Patterns
 * Commonality / variability
 * Programming languages have features which express semantics which help model building
   * Logical | Structural
   * "The interface is the program, the code is crap inbetween"
 * Ignore your customer, listen to your end user.
 * Actual coding is only 5%
 * Human minds see patterns
 * Patterns can be:
   * The same thing repeated
   * recurring commonality
   * recurring variability
 * Programming?
   * Model building
   * Problem solving
   * Programs don't solve problems, they help you solve problems, they are "frameworks"
 * 1967 was when we destroyed the ability to read our source code (aka Fuck SmallTalk/OOP)
 * Domain specific languages take 5-10 years
 * Good languages take time
   * A compiler/translator is the trivial part
   * Learning curve rises with number of languages (huh?)
      * Oh in a company, not for a person

## 1.31.11

 * Objectivity -> Just in time -> agile?
   * Is agile really about caring people?
      * Extreme programming says 40 hours a week max. Period.
 * Things to know
   * trade-offs
   * risks
   * benefits
   * cost-benefit analysis
   * negligence
 * easy, fast, cheap. Choose two.
 * Deontology vs. Utilitarianism.
   * Deontology - not about consequences. Don't lie.
   * Utilitarianism - utility, consequences.
 * What is a corporation viz-a-viz Ethics?
   * Supreme court says they are a person.
   * purpose of a corporation: distribute liability, no personal liability.
      * Make money for shareholders
 * Press isn't as interested in showing up companies?
 * fault vs. cause
   * Afghanistan war deaths vs. Monthly highway deaths
 * just because you don't have a contract, doesn't mean you don't have to pay damages
   * throw a chair in a classroom, hit someone, it's your fault even if it was an accident.
   * Orthogonal - completely different angle
   * social obligations completely different to contracts.

### Software is Different

 * Boris Beizer
 * Software isn't constrained by physical laws
 * Decomposition Principle
   * no mathematical principle
   * true divide and conquer doesn't work
 * perceived quality
 * priorities

   1. write predictable software
   2. Write testable software
   3. write modular code
   4. make a working product
   5. decouple features
   6. make sure software has all essential features

## 2.2.11

 * Talking about licenses, you buy permission to listen to their music
   * "Engineering and social notions of defectiveness and responsibility are challenged by the unique nature of the software product."
 * We can rely on things, so we have time to work on other stuff
   * Software is too unpredictable for our lives (sys-ops shouldn't exist)

### Legal Background

 * Terminology
   * design - intention or plan for a product
   * safety-critical - capable of causing or contributing to personal injury (or property damage)
   * software - non-trivial, safety-critical, mass marketed
   * specifications - requirements, design
   * specification sufficiency - ability of specifications to contain all intentional decisions for code construction
   * product - artifact with dangerous potential sold on mass market.
 *  Innovation by design
   * define: innovate, design
   * Homo Faber: Man, the maker
      * design projects from the known into the unknown
      * promise and optimism about benefits to humans
   * new artifacts alter arrays of potentialities
      * inevitable social costs in new risks
      * someone has to pay those costs (who pays has consequences in the market)
   * the web is a distinct change in human thought, and is constantly changing.
      * Easier to innovate, design
 * Social Progress
   * Social Desire for safety and predictability
      * conflicts with free technical innovation
   * social desire for technical innovation
      * conflicts with safety and predictability
         * "I want new medicine even if it kills a few people first" -- Dr. Clark Savage Turner
   * society (in general) protects and advances its own welfare.
      * one way: social notions of responsibility in tort
      * tort law: balance risks and benefits of innovative tech
      * common law goal is to optimize social welfare
 * TORT LAW
   * Social obligations orthogonal to contract
      * common, "judge made" law
         * dynamic and self correcting
         * requires deterministic algorithm that halts
            * judges + juries must come to a solution.
   * Purpose: allocate costs of technical progress
      * decides who pays for the "inevitable social costs in new risks"
      * either
         * sacrifice victim's interests
         * industry "pays its way"
 * Tort law meets risk artifacts of design
   * a lawsuit is just a bug report
   * "products" - potentially dangerous artifacts
      * must involve personally injury
      * inapplicable to pure "services" (malpractice)
   * general rule of products liability in tort:

 > "One ... who sells .. a defective product is subject to liability for harm ... caused by the defect." [Res99]

 * Defect Classification (slides need to be redone)
   * defect in manufacture
   * defect in design

## 2.04.11

 * descriptive - science, the "state of the world. facts.
   * what is
   * abstraction
      * throw away everything that doesn't apply to the domain.
      * not sure about this definition...
 * normative - what aught to be
   * requirements
 * defect by manufacture
   * if product departs from intended design
   * bring in some experts, they say if you actually implemented the spec
 * defect by design
   * if design safety is not socially defensable
   * Did you do a good job at the time given the constraints.
   * bring in experts, argue if your initial spec was good.
 * we don't have time to know everything, (not my responsibility to know the metal fatigue of my lawn mower).

## 2.07.11

 * giving paper presentation
    * Talk is 10 minutes (10 slides) - go narrow
    * Do slides organize the talk and add to the understanding?
    * Look at people.
    * facts are unbiased
    * narrow focussed issue
    * cover alternative arguments
    * use of ethical principles to come to a conclusion
    * If you fail presentation, you fail the class.
    * slides ahead of time (two days before hand).

Back to slides.

 * Absolute freedom - Perfect Safety
    * two ends of the spectrum in terms of choices for the system
 * Insurance rules the world.
 * you need design intention
    * even if there is no spec, you need intention
 * if the spec is empty, did the code meet the spec?
    * of course, but epic fail
    * but can we say that the spec was in their mind?
 * If you don't think about the spec, you will paying for the damages.
 * Legal Techniques
   * copare to design spec
   * "deviation for the norm" test
      * independent of designer's specifications
 * Software products
   * Innovative artifacts present new risks
      * used in avionics, nuclear, medical
   * no legal precedent yet, but software will soon face a products' suit
      * software considered a product
      * disclaimers become effective.
 * The constitution only describes what the government can and can't do.
   * NDAs for example are legal
   * I wish I wrote my paper on this.
 * Turner's Hypothesis
   * Rational classification of code defects by "stage of production" analogy:
      * software design - design intention
      * software code - product construction
   * question: can software engineers rationally identify the class of arbitrary code flaws?
      * NO. (Turner's Ph.D. Thesis.)
 * Software is one of the few things that you can build and copy identically.

## 2.09.11

 * Legal research is divided
   * Code is just a refinement of the design.
   * Coding mistake as a manufacturing defect.
 * Turner's Definition of Software: "The static description of a dynamic process to be instantiated on a machine."
 * Overview of Argument
   * code construction issues
   * defects of each class exist in code
   * extent tests fail to distinguish rationally
   * difficulty is essential, not accidental
 * One product built and copied identically
 * Inevitable intertwining
   * Code has design decisions.
   * Pressure on coders to deliver working code.
 * Spiral model
 * "The way I want to change the world is expressed in my source code." - Clark S. Turner.
 * Where is "design intention" for code?
   - objective: specifications
   - subjective: coder's mind

For talk

 * Only focus on two SE code points
 * Stuff to think about
    * utilitarianism?
    * deontological?
    * Rwalsian?
    * Objectivism?

 * Nick says:
   * Less work
   * Logos, Pathos, Ethos
      * Logos: the idea of logic
      * Pathos: appeal to emotion
      * Ethos: appeal to authority, I know wtf I am talking about.
   * Presentation should promote what you are saying
   * shortness.
   * no more than 5 bullet points.
   * use common language instead of technical terms when possible.
   * outline beforehand when possible.
   * DON'T GO OVERTIME
   * be prepared for questions
   * make sure these are covered
      * why did you choose the top?
      * why should we care?
      * what is its place in ethics?
      * background of topic?
   * Slides we must have
      * Intro 1 slide
      * Facts 1 slide
      * Focus Question 1
      * Why Care? 1
      * Extant Arguments. 2 slides (pro/con)
      * Analysis 1-3 slides
      * Conclusion 1
      * References

## 2.11.11

 * It won't work.
   * spec insufficiency not new
   * generic manufacturing defects are new (hungover programmer vs. assembly line worker).
   * Better software tools and methods to satisfice.
 * software engineering progress
   * research progress
      * design standards
      * formal specifications [fisher]
   * progress is helpful, but solves a different problem?
   * excel guys put a flight sim inside. Couldn't do that with hardware.
 * depending on the use case specs are read and interpreted differently.
 * No way to determine design spec from code spec.
 * Conclusion
    * software will face products liability law
    * Courts must classify defects
    * rational classification not possible.

## 2.14.11

 * Whee.

# 2.16.11

 * Mutual exclusion
   * see steve jackson's short entitled "Dekker"
   * In a program, how do you make sure two processes don't overwrite each others memory.
      * semaphores
      * deadlocks, livelocks, starvation

## 2.19.11

I gave my talk about building a personal website.

## 2.22.11

Presentations since we didn't read Therac-25.

### Ideas for my presentation

look at section 6.06. Rawls vs. the law maybe?
look at section 2.03 use of property
second categorical imperitive
Maslow's priority of needs
section 3.12

### IP Policy

 * 1999 Bayh-Dole Act
   * Old policy, students are commercial entities?
   * justified by "subsidization" of student fees
   * Student generated IP owned by Poly
      * university owns the IP not the creator
         * like a work for hire
         * IBM vs Cal Poly IP rules
   * what is the incentive to create?
   * Claimed they owned Faculty research
      * what is the polict at Stanford, UCLA?
      * textbook royalties
   * But gave lots of money to creator if they made it big.
   * Required disclosure
   * Any duty to protect or exploit the IP?

 * 2002-2006 new policy
   * You, the IP creator, own the IP
   * University claims quity ownership
      * Only when you use extraordinary resources
   * Whenever you do team work, make sure you make a little IP agreement.
   * different from UC system, which requires you signing the equivelent to an NDA
      * but they have IP lawyers you can talk to.
   * Students own all IPO, but teachers have right to use material in class.
   * Slightly stricter equity sharing rules when you use the extraordinary resources
   * Unresolved
      * IP rights to group projects
