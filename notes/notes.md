 * our paper
   * take a stand in abstract
   * choose a specific case

 * IEEE, microsoft, ACM, AMA code of ethics - check out
   * acm.org/about/se-code

 * We have an ethical code so that people don't shoot each other to solve their problems
   * you can focus on creating instead of just trying to protect your property.
   * what is good?
   * does this code of ethics govern me?
   * are students professionals? are students covered by the code.
 * penalties for disobeying the code?
   * none really right now. why?

   * 4.05

### Ethical Systems Presentations

 1. Present the system - it's advantages / disadvantages
 2. Table of distinctions with the other listed systems (brief, simple)
 3. A worked out example using your system in a software team situation

 * Scientists can't really be argued with in court
 * lookup contingent fees for lawyers

How to answer a turner exam question

 1. Read it over carefully.
 2. Choose separate parts that may be modularized (answered separately).
   * Object Oriented exam answering.
 3. Use sub-headings to separate parts.
 4. When referring to an SE Code provision, utilize both the section number and quote.
   * Narrow and simplify as much as you can to get Turner to believe.
 5. If you aren't answering a question, don't put it in your paper
   * Fluff is bad.
 6. No citations means death
   * "Not documenting means more maintenance" - proof? Citation, how do you know, why should I believe you?
 7. Never start a paragraph with your conclusion
   * you'll be thinking that you're right
   * start with question or fact.
 8. Always use short, simple sentences.
   * less commas, less semi-colons
   * Spelling + Grammar
 9. When you've completed your answer, review it! Did you really answer the question?

 * Read Strunk & White

## 1.24.11

 * Be more skeptical, assume the user doesn't agree with you at all
 * Be a journalist, not a Rush Limbaugh
 * Choose exactly one of the provisions from SE-Code
 * be narrow
 * Truth tables? Do logical proofs?
 * 2/3 paragraphs, 1 page.
 * start paragraph w/ question or controversial fact.
   * not conclusion.
 * Dialectic - classic dialog and discussion
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic

   * synthesis
 * talk about letters of recommendation

Talk by Jim "Cope" Coplien

 * Form not structure, but rather the "essence of structure"
 * Patterns
 * Commonality / variability
 * Programming languages have features which express semanitcs which help model building
   * Logical | Structural
   * "The interface is the program, the code is crap inbetween" 
 * Ignore your customer, listen to your end user.
 * Actual coding is only 5%
 * Human minds see patterns
 * Patterns can be:
   * The same thing repeated
   * recurring commonality
   * recurring variability
 * Programming?
   * Model building
   * Problem solving
   * Programs don't solve problems, they help you solve problems, they are "frameworks"
 * 1967 was when we destroyed the ability to read our source code (aka Fuck SmallTalk/OOP)
 * Domain specific languages take 5-10 years
 * Good languages take time 
   * A compiler/translator is the trivial part
   * Learning curve rises with number of languages (huh?)
      * Oh in a company, not for a person
