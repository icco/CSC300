## 1.7.10

Talked about the two articles we wrote.

## 1.10.11

 * should men really be focused on power / money?
 * pregnant women are awesome?
 * interesting to talk about men / women and chivalry.
   * how does this affect computer science?
 * internet wiretapping - steven holtzapple
 * new example papers online

 * our paper
   * take a stand in abstract
   * choose a specific case

 * IEEE, microsoft, ACM, AMA code of ethics - check out
   * acm.org/about/se-code

 * We have an ethical code so that people don't shoot each other to solve their problems
   * you can focus on creating instead of just trying to protect your property.
   * what is good?
   * does this code of ethics govern me?
   * are students professionals? are students covered by the code.
 * penalties for disobeying the code?
   * none really right now. why?
 * conflicts of interest - make sure you know define
   * 4.05

### Ethical Systems Presentations

 1. Present the system - it's advantages / disadvantages
 2. Table of distinctions with the other listed systems (brief, simple)
 3. A worked out example using your system in a software team situation

 * 15-20 min
 * slides good but optional
   * handout, webpage would work as well
 * everyone needs to talk

We are talking on Objectivism + Relativism

## 1.12.11

He had his coffee today, jumping right into stuff.

### How to read a paper / book

 1. Author Info
   a. Why?
   b. Where now?
 2. High level mechanical
   a. what question does author address
   b. what do they conclude?
   c. look over index, bibliography, glossary.
 3. A quick read
 4. A careful read
   a. notes
   b. what question do they address?
   c. what are the main tradeoffs / arguments - super duper important
   d. What arguments support the author's conclusion? How sound are they?
   e. Is this an important result?

### Testing Reliability Article

 * Not attacking anyone
 * very few bibliographys
 * Last paragraph summarizes article nicely
   * is he telling the truth - we think so.
 * No glossary
   * cool sidebars with useful info
 * MTTF - Mean time to Fauilure

   * fault
   * failure
   * error
   * bug
 * Reliability - Program meeting spec?
 * Picking inputs, but the state could be messed up.
   * everything is dependent on what has come before it.
 * myths
   * Defect free software
   * testing away failure

## 1.14.11

 * We have the least authority to decide if our projects have value (good/bad/etc)
 * if you are inventing something new (nuclear power), you can't declare the mean time to failure as 100 years.
 * Trans-science: making decisions on value judgments and on things that can't be tested realistically.
 * Scientists can't really be argued with in court
 * lookup contingent fees for lawyers
 * how does bringing software into things make it different (good thought for paper)
   * you're writing instructions for a machine
   * static instructions for a dynamic machine

## 1.19.11

 * Why just have a CSC ethics course?
 * Has the world changed enough that old ethics don't apply?
   * How do you define steal now?
 * What new things do computing bring to society / ethics?
   * rights?
   * Statue to Queen Ann and copyrights
      * ideas should be free
   * treat abstractions as "real" and concrete
   * Apple vs. Franklin
   * pseudo-random behavior
   * power and pervasiveness
 * TCAT System - Fly by wire

## 1.21.11

How to answer a turner exam question

 1. Read it over carefully.
 2. Choose separate parts that may be modularized (answered separately).
   * Object Oriented exam answering.
 3. Use sub-headings to separate parts.
 4. When referring to an SE Code provision, utilize both the section number and quote.
   * Narrow and simplify as much as you can to get Turner to believe.
 5. If you aren't answering a question, don't put it in your paper
   * Fluff is bad.
 6. No citations means death
   * "Not documenting means more maintenance" - proof? Citation, how do you know, why should I believe you?
 7. Never start a paragraph with your conclusion
   * you'll be thinking that you're right
   * start with question or fact.
 8. Always use short, simple sentences.
   * less commas, less semi-colons
   * Spelling + Grammar
 9. When you've completed your answer, review it! Did you really answer the question?

 * Read Strunk & White

## 1.24.11

 * Be more skeptical, assume the user doesn't agree with you at all
 * Be a journalist, not a Rush Limbaugh
 * Choose exactly one of the provisions from SE-Code
 * be narrow
 * Truth tables? Do logical proofs?
 * 2/3 paragraphs, 1 page.
 * start paragraph w/ question or controversial fact.
   * not conclusion.
 * Dialectic - classic dialog and discussion
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic
   * Thesis
   * antithesis
   * synthesis
 * talk about letters of recommendation

## 1.28.11

Talk by Jim "Cope" Coplien

 * Form not structure, but rather the "essence of structure"
 * Patterns
 * Commonality / variability
 * Programming languages have features which express semantics which help model building
   * Logical | Structural
   * "The interface is the program, the code is crap inbetween" 
 * Ignore your customer, listen to your end user.
 * Actual coding is only 5%
 * Human minds see patterns
 * Patterns can be:
   * The same thing repeated
   * recurring commonality
   * recurring variability
 * Programming?
   * Model building
   * Problem solving
   * Programs don't solve problems, they help you solve problems, they are "frameworks"
 * 1967 was when we destroyed the ability to read our source code (aka Fuck SmallTalk/OOP)
 * Domain specific languages take 5-10 years
 * Good languages take time 
   * A compiler/translator is the trivial part
   * Learning curve rises with number of languages (huh?)
      * Oh in a company, not for a person

## 1.31.11

 * Objectivity -> Just in time -> agile?
   * Is agile really about caring people?
      * Extreme programming says 40 hours a week max. Period.
 * Things to know
   * trade-offs
   * risks
   * benefits
   * cost-benefit analysis
   * negligence
 * easy, fast, cheap. Choose two.
 * Deontology vs. Utilitarianism.
   * Deontology - not about consequences. Don't lie.
   * Utilitarianism - utility, consequences.
 * What is a corporation viz-a-viz Ethics?
   * Supreme court says they are a person.
   * purpose of a corporation: distribute liability, no personal liability.
      * Make money for shareholders
 * Press isn't as interested in showing up companies?
 * fault vs. cause
   * Afghanistan war deaths vs. Monthly highway deaths 
 * just because you don't have a contract, doesn't mean you don't have to pay damages
   * throw a chair in a classroom, hit someone, it's your fault even if it was an accident.
   * Orthogonal - completely different angle
   * social obligations completely different to contracts.

### Software is Different

 * Boris Beizer
 * Software isn't constrained by physical laws
 * Decomposition Principle
   * no mathematical principle
   * true divide and conquer doesn't work
 * perceived quality
 * priorities

   1. write predictable software
   2. Write testable software
   3. write modular code
   4. make a working product
   5. decouple features
   6. make sure software has all essential features
