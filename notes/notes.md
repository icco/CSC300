## 1.7.10

Talked about the two articles we wrote.

## 1.10.11

 * should men really be focused on power / money?
 * pregnant women are awesome?
 * interesting to talk about men / women and chivalry.
   * how does this affect computer science?
 * internet wiretapping - steven holtzapple
 * new example papers online

 * our paper
   * take a stand in abstract
   * choose a specific case

 * IEEE, microsoft, ACM, AMA code of ethics - check out
   * acm.org/about/se-code

 * We have an ethical code so that people don't shoot each other to solve their problems
   * you can focus on creating instead of just trying to protect your property.
   * what is good?
   * does this code of ethics govern me?
   * are students professionals? are students covered by the code.
 * penalties for disobeying the code?
   * none really right now. why?
 * conflicts of interest - make sure you know define
   * 4.05

### Ethical Systems Presentations

 1. Present the system - it's advantages / disadvantages
 2. Table of distinctions with the other listed systems (brief, simple)
 3. A worked out example using your system in a software team situation

 * 15-20 min
 * slides good but optional
   * handout, webpage would work as well
 * everyone needs to talk

We are talking on Objectivism + Relativism

## 1.12.11

He had his coffee today, jumping right into stuff.

### How to read a paper / book

 1. Author Info
   a. Why?
   b. Where now?
 2. High level mechanical
   a. what question does author address
   b. what do they conclude?
   c. look over index, bibliography, glossary.
 3. A quick read
 4. A careful read
   a. notes
   b. what question do they address?
   c. what are the main tradeoffs / arguments - super duper important
   d. What arguments support the author's conclusion? How sound are they?
   e. Is this an important result?

### Testing Reliability Article

   * testing away failure

## 1.14.11

 * We have the least authority to decide if our projects have value (good/bad/etc)
 * if you are inventing something new (nuclear power), you can't declare the mean time to failure as 100 years.
 * Trans-science: making decisions on value judgments and on things that can't be tested realistically.
 * Scientists can't really be argued with in court
 * lookup contingent fees for lawyers
 * how does bringing software into things make it different (good thought for paper)
   * you're writing instructions for a machine
   * static instructions for a dynamic machine

## 1.21.11

How to answer a turner exam question

 1. Read it over carefully.
 2. Choose separate parts that may be modularized (answered separately).
   * Object Oriented exam answering.
 3. Use sub-headings to separate parts.
 4. When referring to an SE Code provision, utilize both the section number and quote.
   * Narrow and simplify as much as you can to get Turner to believe.
 5. If you aren't answering a question, don't put it in your paper
   * Fluff is bad.
 6. No citations means death
   * "Not documenting means more maintenance" - proof? Citation, how do you know, why should I believe you?
 7. Never start a paragraph with your conclusion
   * you'll be thinking that you're right
   * start with question or fact.
 8. Always use short, simple sentences.
   * less commas, less semi-colons
   * Spelling + Grammar
 9. When you've completed your answer, review it! Did you really answer the question?

 * Read Strunk & White

## 1.24.11

 * Be more skeptical, assume the user doesn't agree with you at all
 * Be a journalist, not a Rush Limbaugh
 * Choose exactly one of the provisions from SE-Code
 * be narrow
 * Truth tables? Do logical proofs?
 * 2/3 paragraphs, 1 page.
 * start paragraph w/ question or controversial fact.
   * not conclusion.
 * Dialectic - classic dialog and discussion
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic
   * Thesis
   * antithesis
   * synthesis
 * talk about letters of recommendation

## 1.28.11

Talk by Jim "Cope" Coplien

 * Form not structure, but rather the "essence of structure"
 * Patterns
 * Commonality / variability
 * Programming languages have features which express semantics which help model building
   * Logical | Structural
   * "The interface is the program, the code is crap inbetween"
 * Ignore your customer, listen to your end user.
 * Actual coding is only 5%
 * Human minds see patterns
 * Patterns can be:
   * The same thing repeated
   * recurring commonality
   * recurring variability
 * Programming?
   * Model building
   * Problem solving
   * Programs don't solve problems, they help you solve problems, they are "frameworks"
 * 1967 was when we destroyed the ability to read our source code (aka Fuck SmallTalk/OOP)
 * Domain specific languages take 5-10 years
 * Good languages take time
   * A compiler/translator is the trivial part
   * Learning curve rises with number of languages (huh?)
      * Oh in a company, not for a person

## 1.31.11

 * Objectivity -> Just in time -> agile?
   * Is agile really about caring people?
      * Extreme programming says 40 hours a week max. Period.
 * Things to know
   * trade-offs
   * risks
   * benefits
   * cost-benefit analysis
   * negligence
 * easy, fast, cheap. Choose two.
 * Deontology vs. Utilitarianism.
   * Deontology - not about consequences. Don't lie.
   * Utilitarianism - utility, consequences.
 * What is a corporation viz-a-viz Ethics?
   * Supreme court says they are a person.
   * purpose of a corporation: distribute liability, no personal liability.
      * Make money for shareholders
 * Press isn't as interested in showing up companies?
 * fault vs. cause
   * Afghanistan war deaths vs. Monthly highway deaths
 * just because you don't have a contract, doesn't mean you don't have to pay damages
   * throw a chair in a classroom, hit someone, it's your fault even if it was an accident.
   * Orthogonal - completely different angle
   * social obligations completely different to contracts.

### Software is Different

 * Boris Beizer
 * Software isn't constrained by physical laws
 * Decomposition Principle
   * no mathematical principle
   * true divide and conquer doesn't work
 * perceived quality
 * priorities

   1. write predictable software
   2. Write testable software
   3. write modular code
   4. make a working product
   5. decouple features
   6. make sure software has all essential features

## 2.2.11

 * Talking about licenses, you buy permission to listen to their music
   * "Engineering and social notions of defectiveness and responsibility are challenged by the unique nature of the software product."
 * We can rely on things, so we have time to work on other stuff
   * Software is too unpredictable for our lives (sys-ops shouldn't exist)

### Legal Background

 * Terminology
   * design - intention or plan for a product
   * safety-critical - capable of causing or contributing to personal injury (or property damage)
   * software - non-trivial, safety-critical, mass marketed
   * specifications - requirements, design
   * specification sufficiency - ability of specifications to contain all intentional decisions for code construction
   * product - artifact with dangerous potential sold on mass market.
 *  Innovation by design
   * define: innovate, design
   * Homo Faber: Man, the maker
      * design projects from the known into the unknown
      * promise and optimism about benefits to humans
   * new artifacts alter arrays of potentialities
      * inevitable social costs in new risks
      * someone has to pay those costs (who pays has consequences in the market)
   * the web is a distinct change in human thought, and is constantly changing.
      * Easier to innovate, design
 * Social Progress
   * Social Desire for safety and predictability
      * conflicts with free technical innovation
   * social desire for technical innovation
      * conflicts with safety and predictability
         * "I want new medicine even if it kills a few people first" -- Dr. Clark Savage Turner
   * society (in general) protects and advances its own welfare.
      * one way: social notions of responsibility in tort
      * tort law: balance risks and benefits of innovative tech
      * common law goal is to optimize social welfare
 * TORT LAW
   * Social obligations orthogonal to contract
      * common, "judge made" law
         * dynamic and self correcting
         * requires deterministic algorithm that halts
            * judges + juries must come to a solution.
   * Purpose: allocate costs of technical progress
      * decides who pays for the "inevitable social costs in new risks"
      * either
         * sacrifice victim's interests
         * industry "pays its way"
 * Tort law meets risk artifacts of design
   * a lawsuit is just a bug report
   * "products" - potentially dangerous artifacts
      * must involve personally injury
      * inapplicable to pure "services" (malpractice)
   * general rule of products liability in tort:

 > "One ... who sells .. a defective product is subject to liability for harm ... caused by the defect." [Res99]

 * Defect Classification (slides need to be redone)
   * defect in manufacture
   * defect in design

## 2.04.11

 * descriptive - science, the "state of the world. facts.
   * what is
   * abstraction
      * throw away everything that doesn't apply to the domain.
      * not sure about this definition...
 * normative - what aught to be
   * requirements
 * defect by manufacture
   * if product departs from intended design
   * bring in some experts, they say if you actually implemented the spec
 * defect by design
   * if design safety is not socially defensable
   * Did you do a good job at the time given the constraints.
   * bring in experts, argue if your initial spec was good.
 * we don't have time to know everything, (not my responsibility to know the metal fatigue of my lawn mower).

## 2.07.11

 * Talk is 10 minutes (10 slides) - go narrow
 * ask questions

Back to slides.

 * Absolute freedom - Perfect Safety
    * two ends of the spectrum in terms of choices for the system
 * Insurance rules the world.
 * you need design intention
    * even if there is no spec, you need intention
 * if the spec is empty, did the code meet the spec?
    * of course, but epic fail
    * but can we say that the spec was in their mind?
 * If you don't think about the spec, you will paying for the damages.
 * Legal Techniques
   * copare to design spec
   * "deviation for the norm" test
      * independent of designer's specifications
 * Software products
   * Innovative artifacts present new risks
      * used in avionics, nuclear, medical
   * no legal precedent yet, but software will soon face a products' suit
      * software considered a product
      * disclaimers become effective.
 * The constitution only describes what the government can and can't do.
   * NDAs for example are legal
   * I wish I wrote my paper on this.
 * Turner's Hypothesis
   * Rational classification of code defects by "stage of production" analogy:
      * software design - design intention
      * software code - product construction
   * question: can software engineers rationally identify the class of arbitrary code flaws?
      * NO. (Turner's Ph.D. Thesis.)
 * Software is one of the few things that you can build and copy identically.
